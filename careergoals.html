                                    <p>
                                        I started coding when I was 18. I enjoyed computer science related subjects, such as math and statistics, but I didn’t explore my high school’s computer science classes. My idea of pursuing computer science formed during the college application process, when I was indecisive about declaring major. I figured I’d enjoy computer science because it requires strong problem-solving abilities. I’d been playing chess competitively for eleven years. I’d been to competitive math competitions. I thought I was ready for a CS major. I was wrong. Reality slapped me in the face freshman year. I struggled with intro level classes, and I questioned my major choice on a daily basis. TAs held my hand through projects. I went to my professor’s office hours religiously to keep up with class content. My ego was shattered and I began to learn. Software design principles and objected oriented programming began to make sense. My coding confidence grew after I completed a few projects without assistance. After freshman year, I could stand on my feet as a computer scientist.

                                        This year, my sophomore year, I began to look around and explore niches in computer science. I joined the OSU’s Big Data Analytics Association, where I was introduced to data analytics and data science. After winning my first data hackathon, the 2021 OSU Climathon, I realized that enjoyed and wanted to specialize in data. I participated in three other data hackathons this school year, winning two and placing as a finalist in the third. My experience at hackathons drove me to learn new methods and apply technologies I’d learned. For example, at the 2021 Data I/O one of my teammates used a random forest model to conduct statistical analysis on our Twitter data set. This was my first exposure to machine learning. Curious, I created a DataCamp account and took a course on Sci-kit learn, Python’s machine learning library. Outside of hackathon season, during winter break, I taught myself PostgreSQL.

                                        I’m preparing to accomplish my goal after graduation: securing a job as a full stack data scientist. I’ve explored most facets of the data life cycle –- databases, data cleaning, statistical modeling, and hyperparameter tuning -- but I have to develop deep knowledge in each of those areas. I will practice my database and statistical modeling skills over the summer of 2022 as a data analyst intern at the Byrd Polar Research intern. Side projects on Kaggle will help me learn and apply statistical modeling and hyperparameter tuning. Future data science internships will give me exposure to industry practices and workflows.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Two years after securing a full stack data scientist position, I plan on taking a break and pursuing an MBA. I want to explore the management side of tech companies and develop my leadership capabilities. I believe that acquiring an MBA and climbing the corporate ladder will increase my longevity in the tech sector. Programmers tend to burn out quickly at major tech companies. To prepare for my foray into leadership, I plan on studying for the GMAT a year after graduation. I’m preparing a year in advance so that I can get into a top ten business school and secure financial aid. Admission into a top school will give me better resources and connections, which will be valuable for the rest of my career. 
                                    </p>
